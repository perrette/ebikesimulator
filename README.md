How much energy is required for this track?

Look at [range_calculator.ipynb](range_calculator.ipynb) to see what I mean.

It reads gpx track (must have elevation) and calculate energy requirements.
It is not tested (yet) against real data.
It is very prelimary with respect to real motor efficiency.

It could be improved and organized in an online tool like https://www.ebikes.ca/tools/simulator.html

Note that at this point the repository is used by myself to know which ebike system/battery packs to use, and put here for sharing with friends/interested people, it is not a user-friendly tool.
